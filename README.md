# YOLO-Computer-Vision
I have created an object detection model using Python. I have used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model with subprojects utilizing pre-trained and self-trained data for accurate object detection.
The model excels in object detection from images/videos and achieves real-time performance via webcam.
I've applied specific models to enable distinct functions, such as...
-Counting cars crossing a specific road point. 
-Trained self-made model using ML techniques which detects the Playing Cards from the webcam and can clasify the poker hand in a group of 5 cards.
